% (AJL) This is just for testing the simulator out a bit to see if it is
% working at all. 

% I am going to run the simulation for n time-intervals. Over each
% time-interval I am going to at random pick a set of muscles to use,
% and randomly pick their muscle activation level. The duration of each
% time-interval is randomly generated as well. The muscle activations are
% held constanct during the interval. 

% Set the time-step for the simulation
dt = .001;

% Pick the number of n time-intervals
numb_time_intervals = 20;

% Initialize the system.
theta_1 = pi/2;
theta_1_dot = 0.0;
theta_2 = pi/2;
theta_2_dot = 0.0;

% Plot out the initial state of the system.
arm_plotter(theta_1, theta_2, zeros(6,1))

% Iterate over the n intervals
for i=1:numb_time_intervals

    % For time-interval i, pick which muscles (there are six of them) that 
    % will be active, then assign those active muscles a
    is_act = rand(6,1);
    is_act(is_act>=.2) = 0;
    is_act(is_act>0) = 1;
    is_act = rand(6,1).*is_act;
    
    alpha = is_act;
    
    % Amount of time
    time = rand(1)*.4 + .1;
    
    intervals = floor(time/dt);
    
    if sum(is_act)>.01
    for j=1:intervals
        
        [theta_1, theta_1_dot, theta_2, theta_2_dot] = arm_model(theta_1, theta_1_dot, theta_2, theta_2_dot, alpha, dt);
        
        if mod(j,10)==0
        fprintf('\nPlotting time-step %g or %g',j,intervals)
        arm_plotter(theta_1, theta_2, alpha)
